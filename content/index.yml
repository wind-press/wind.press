      quote: So impressed with this plugin. I can vouch for the Bricks Builder version working perfectly when it comes to auto-complete and front-end rendering. But, that is not why I give this a 5/5. Josh, the author has been amazing with taking feedback and implementing changes. The support along with the plugin is amazing! I couldn't ask for a better tool to implement Tailwind into WordPress.

Estoy comenzando a usarlo y, hasta ahora, la experiencia ha sido excelente. Además, el soporte que brindan es de primera clase.

    - quote_title: A Tailwind Plugin That Shines with Bricks Builder
      quote: WindPress has been a fantastic tool in my design process with Bricks Builder. The plugin integrates smoothly, making it effortless to apply Tailwind CSS within Bricks, allowing for rapid customization without sacrificing design quality or responsiveness. Even though I primarily use Bricks, it's worth mentioning that WindPress works equally well with many other site builders. Its flexibility across platforms makes it a solid choice for anyone looking to streamline their Tailwind workflow. If you're using Bricks or any other builder and want a reliable way to implement Tailwind, WindPress is definitely worth it!
