[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is one of the [most popular](https://2023.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-frameworks/) CSS frameworks in the world besides Bootstrap. It is known for its utility-first approach which is both user-friendly and easy to use, making it a top choice for developers. Additionally, its flexible configuration allows developers to customize it to their needs, making it a go-to option for many projects.

However, the use of Tailwind CSS in WordPress is still limited to theme usage, and it requires a development environment that supports modern Javascript build tools. The increasing popularity of WordPress page builders like Gutenberg, Elementor, Oxygen, and Bricks has created a high demand for integrating Tailwind CSS directly into WordPress without the need for a development environment that supports modern Javascript build tools. This is where [WindPress](/) comes in.
