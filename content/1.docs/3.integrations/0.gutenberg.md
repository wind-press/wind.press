## What is Gutenberg?

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is the new default WordPress editor. It is the block editor, introducing a modular approach to website customization. It allows users to edit individual content blocks on posts or pages, add and adjust widgets, and design site headers, footers, and navigation with full site editing support. Each piece of content in the editor, from a paragraph to an image gallery to a headline, is its own block. These blocks can be added, arranged, and rearranged, enabling users to create media-rich content and site layouts in a visually intuitive way without workarounds like shortcodes or custom HTML and PHP.

Following the introduction of post block editing in December 2018, Gutenberg later introduced full site editing (FSE) in 2021, which shipped with WordPress 5.9 in early 2022. The project is divided into four phases: Easier Editing, Customization, Collaboration, and Multilingual. Currently, Phase 2 of the Gutenberg project formally wrapped with WordPress 6.3, and exploration of Phase 3 (Collaboration) is underway.

Tailwind CSS `4.x` relies heavily on [CSS layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer), which can make overriding WordPress CSS in your WindPress configuration tricky. By default, styles defined within a CSS `@layer` have lower specificity compared to styles without a layer.

For example, WordPress loads a `common.css` file across the admin editor, including the Gutenberg editor. This file applies default styles, such as margins for headings and paragraphs, that may not exist on the frontend of your site. This mismatch can be frustrating, as it often leads to discrepancies between how your website looks on the backend versus the frontend.

To address this issue, we have a small piece of code that moves all WordPress styles into the "base" layer. This allows us to apply a reset in the WindPress configuration, making WindPress the most authoritative CSS file in the editor. With this approach, you regain full control over your styles and ensure consistency across your site.

We're going to enqueue the following JavaScript code in the editor with the `enqueue_block_editor_assets` hook: 

```php
add_action('enqueue_block_editor_assets', function() {
    $screen = get_current_screen();
    if (is_admin() && $screen->is_block_editor()) {
        add_action('admin_head', function() {
            echo <<<'JS'
<script>
    (async () => {
        // Select all external stylesheets
        const links = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('link[rel="stylesheet"]'));
        for (const link of links) {
            const href = link.href;
            try {
                // Fetch the CSS content
                const response = await fetch(href);
                if (!response.ok) {
                    console.error(`Failed to fetch stylesheet: ${href}`);
                    continue;
                }
                const css = await response.text();
                // Wrap the CSS in @layer base
                const wrappedCSS = `@layer base {\n${css}\n}`;
                // Create a <style> element to inject the wrapped CSS
                const style = document.createElement('style');
                style.textContent = wrappedCSS;
                // Replace the <link> tag with the <style> tag
                link.parentNode.replaceChild(style, link);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(`Error processing stylesheet: ${href}`, error);
            }
        }
    })();
</script>
JS;
        }, 1_000_001);
    }
});

```

Then, in your WindPress `main.css` file, adjust the content to include the reset:

```css [main.css]
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;
@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);
/* @import 'tailwindcss/preflight.css' layer(base); */
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);

/* reset: Gutenberg and Frontend parity */
@layer base {
    /* Gutenberg reset */
    html :where(.editor-styles-wrapper) :where([id^='block-']) {
        line-height: 1.5;

        &,
        &::after,
        &::backdrop,
        &::before {
            box-sizing: border-box;
            border: none;
            background: none;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
    }

    /* Frontend reset */
    html :where(body:not(.wp-admin)) {
        line-height: 1.5;

        *,
        ::after,
        ::backdrop,
        ::before {
            box-sizing: border-box;
            border: none;
            background: none;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
    }
}
```
