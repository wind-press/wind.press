description: Learn how to customize the main.css file in WindPress
---

When you need to add truly custom CSS rules to the project, the easiest approach is to just add the custom CSS into the `main.css` file. It acts as the primary stylesheet reference for Tailwind CSS when it creates the styles.

To customize the `main.css` file, you can go to `WindPress` menu and switch to `main.css` file editor.

## `3.x`

### Default content

When using Tailwind CSS `3.x`, the default content of the `main.css` file is as follows:

```css [main.css]
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
You can reset the `main.css` file to its default by clearing its contents and clicking the `Save Changes` button.
::


## `4.x`

### Default content

When using Tailwind CSS `4.x`, the default content of the  `main.css` file is as follows:

```css [main.css]
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);
/* @import 'tailwindcss/preflight.css' layer(base); */
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
You can reset the `main.css` file to its default by clearing its contents and clicking the `Save Changes` button.
::

### Preflight

Preflight styles are the base styles that normalize the browser styles to ensure a consistent look and feel across different browsers.

In Tailwind CSS `4.x`, the Preflight styles can be enabled by importing the `tailwindcss/preflight.css` file into the `main.css` file.

<div class="leading-6">
Due to the nature of the normalizing styles, they can be intrusive and may affect the existing styles in your project. To deliver an experience that is seamless with the existing styles in your project, the Preflight styles are disabled by default in WindPress.
</div>
::

You can enable the Preflight on your project by uncommenting the `@import 'tailwindcss/preflight.css' layer(base);` line in the `main.css` file.

```css [main.css]
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);
@import 'tailwindcss/preflight.css' layer(base); /* [!code ++] */
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);
```

### Importing additional CSS files

WindPress has a [simple file system](/docs/advanced/simple-file-system/) that allows you to create local custom CSS files and can be referenced in the `main.css` file using the `@import` at-rule with the relative path to the file (started with `./`).

Additionally, if the path to the file is not an url or relative path, WindPress will try to resolve it as a npm package via [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/).

For example, you can create custom CSS files and import them into the `main.css` file as shown below:

::code-group

```css [main.css]
/* this is Simple File System */
@import './theme/color.css';
@import './custom/avatar.css';
@import './custom/buttons.css';

/* this is CDN URL */
@import 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css';

/* this is npm package */
@import 'daisyui@beta'; /* this will be loaded from https://esm.sh/daisyui@beta/index.css */
@import 'open-props/buttons.min.css'; /* this will be loaded from https://esm.sh/open-props/buttons.min.css */
```

```css [theme/color.css]
@theme {
    --color-*: initial;

    --color-primary: #3490dc;
    --color-secondary: #ffed4a;

    --color-text: #333;
}
```

```css [custom/avatar.css]
.avatar {
    width: var(--avatar-size, 100px);
    height: var(--avatar-size, 100px);
    padding: var(--spacing-4, 1rem);
    border-radius: var(--avatar-radius, var(--radius-lg, 0.5rem));
}
```

```css [custom/buttons.css]
/* Custom button styles */
```

### Tailwind CSS plugins

In the Tailwind CSS `4.x`, a Tailwind CSS plugin can be added to the project by importing the plugin file into the `main.css` file using the `@plugin` directive.

The Tailwind CSS plugins can be added via CDN or local files.

With the WindPress' simple file system, you can create local custom Tailwind CSS plugins and import them into the `main.css` file with the relative path to the file (started with `./`).

Additionally, if the path to the file is not an url or relative path, WindPress will try to resolve it as a npm package via [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/).

For example, you can add the `@tailwindcss/typography` and `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin to the project by importing the plugin file via the [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/), [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) or [Skypack](https://cdn.skypack.dev) CDN into the `main.css` file as shown below:

```postcss [main.css]
/* via esm.sh CDN */
@plugin 'https://esm.sh/@tailwindcss/typography'; 
@plugin '@tailwindcss/forms' { /* this will be loaded from https://esm.sh/@tailwindcss/typography */
    strategy: 'class';
}

/* via Skypack CDN */
@plugin 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@tailwindcss/typography';
@plugin 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@tailwindcss/forms' {
    strategy: 'class';
}

/* via jsDelivr CDN */
@plugin 'https://esm.run/@tailwindcss/typography';
@plugin 'https://esm.run/@tailwindcss/forms' {
    strategy: 'class';
}
```

### Tailwind CSS configuration

In the Tailwind CSS `4.x`, the Tailwind CSS configuration can be imported into the `main.css` file using the `@config` directive  via CDN or local files.

With the WindPress' simple file system, you can create local custom Tailwind CSS configuration files and import them into the `main.css` file with the relative path to the file (started with `./`).

The Tailwind CSS configuration supports the [JavaScript package](/docs/configuration/file-tailwind-config-js/#javascript-package).

For example, you can customize the Tailwind CSS configuration by importing the `tailwind.config.js` file into the `main.css` file as shown below:

```css [main.css]
@config './tailwind.config.js';
```

### Scanning additional Sources

#description
<div class="leading-6">
The WindPress implementation of the <code>@source</code> directive in the <code>main.css</code> file is different from the <u><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#source-directive" target="_blank">original implementation</a></u> of Tailwind CSS v4 and may not be compatible with it.
</div>
::

In the [production environment](/docs/advanced/cache#production), WindPress scan your project to create a single CSS file that includes only the styles that are used.

To scan additional source files, you can add the source files to the `main.css` file using the `@source` directive.

Currently, WindPress supports the following providers can be used to scan the source files:

#### File URL

A static file is added as the source using the file URL.

The pattern to add the source from the file URL is as follows:

```css [main.css]
@source '[file_url]';
```

The `file_url` is the URL of the file that you want to add as the source.

For example, you can add the source from the file URL using the `@source` directive as shown below:

```css [main.css]
@source "https://esm.sh/flowbite/dist/flowbite.min.js?raw";
```

#### jsDelivr CDN

Some of Tailwind CSS libraries may require you to scan their package content from the `node_modules` directory.

As WindPress run on the browser, it doesn't use the Node.js environment to scan the package content from the `node_modules` directory. To scan the package content from the `node_modules` directory, we can use the jsDelivr CDN which provides the package content via CDN.

The patern to scan the package content from the jsDelivr CDN is as follows:

```css [main.css]
@source "jsdelivr:[package_name][@version][/file_path]";
```

The `package_name` is the name of the package. The `version` is the version of the package. The `file_path` is the path to the file that you want to add as the source, it support the glob pattern.

For example, to scan the `node_modules/preline/dist/*.js` file from the `preline` package, you can add the source from the jsDelivr CDN using the `@source` directive as shown below:

```css [main.css]
@source "jsdelivr:preline@2.7.0/dist/*.js";
```

#### wp-content directory

WindPress allows you to scan the source files from the `wp-content` directory of the WordPress installation.

The pattern to add the source from the `wp-content` directory is as follows:

```css [main.css]
@source "wp-content:[file_path]";
```

The `file_path` is the path to the file that you want to add as the source, it support the glob pattern.

For example, to scan our custom theme named `my-theme` from the `wp-content/themes/my-theme` directory for any `php`, `html`, `twig`, and `js` files as the source, you can using the `@source` directive as shown below:

```css [main.css]
@source "wp-content:themes/my-theme/**/*.{php,html,twig,js}";
```
