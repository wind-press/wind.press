At the time of writing this guide, version `3.x` is the latest stable version of Tailwind CSS. However, the Tailwind CSS team is actively working on the next major version, `4.x`, which is expected to be released soon. WindPress will continue to support both versions of Tailwind CSS to ensure that users can choose the version that best suits their needs.

## Switching Tailwind CSS Versions

However, you can easily switch to version `3.x`, and vice versa, by following these steps:

### Step 1: Navigate to the WindPress admin screen

Navigate to the `WindPress` menu.

### Step 6: Update the `main.css` file and Save the changes

As the `v3.x` and `v4.x` versions of Tailwind CSS have different approaches to define and customize the Tailwind configuration, you must update the `main.css` file accordingly. Remember to save the changes after updating the `main.css` file.
