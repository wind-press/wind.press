Tailwind CSS generates CSS based on the actual usage of the project, aiming to produce the smallest possible CSS file and improve performance. Even for large projects, when combined with minification, Tailwind CSS generate a single CSS file that's less than 5kB, which can be downloaded once and cached for all pages.

## Environments

WindPress uses a hybrid approach to integrate Tailwind CSS into WordPress.

### Development

During development, WindPress loads the development libraries to provide the full Tailwind CSS experience, including the compiler, which allows you to use any Tailwind CSS classes and generates the styles on-demand.

### Production

You can command WindPress to generate a tiny single cached CSS file for the most performance in the production environment. WindPress will scan the project for all the Tailwind CSS classes used and generate a single CSS file containing only the styles used in the project.

The cached CSS file is generated using the same compiler as the development environment to ensure consistent styles across both environments. To further optimize it, WindPress uses [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) for vendor prefixing, fallbacks for modern syntaxes, handling nesting, and minifying to create the smallest possible build with the widest browser support.
