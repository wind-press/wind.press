WindPress will continue to support both versions of Tailwind CSS to ensure that users can choose the version that best suits their needs.

## Switching Tailwind CSS Versions

On a fresh WindPress installation, the default active version of Tailwind CSS is `4.x`.
However, you can easily switch to version `3.x`, and vice versa, by following these steps:

### Step 1: Navigate to the WindPress admin screen

On the left sidebar menu of the WordPress admin dashboard, click on the `WindPress` icon to open the WindPress admin screen.

### Step 2: Switch to Settings page

Click on the `Settings â†’ General` submenu.

### Step 6: Update the `main.css` file and Save the changes

As the `v3.x` and `v4.x` versions of Tailwind CSS have different approaches to define and customize the Tailwind configuration, you must update the `main.css` file accordingly. Remember to save the changes after updating the `main.css` file.
