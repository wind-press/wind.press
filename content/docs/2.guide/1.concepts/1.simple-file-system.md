The Simple File System in WindPress is a feature that allows you to manage the files in your project. It provides a simple interface to create, edit, and delete files in your project.

The supported file types are:
- CSS files (`.css`)
- JavaScript files (`.js`)

This limitation is to minimize the security risks and complexity of WindPress while providing the essential features to manage the files in your project.

The Simple File System will load and store the files in the `/wp-content/uploads/windpress/data` directory.

```bash
wp-content/
└─ uploads/
   └─ windpress/
      └─ data/
         ├── main.css
         ├── tailwind.config.js 
         ├──  ...
         └── some-folder/
             ├── some-file.css
             ├── some-file.js
             └── ...
```

## Managing files

The Simple File System can be accessed on the left sidebar of the WindPress admin dashboard.
