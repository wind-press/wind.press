Today we are so excited to announce that WindPress is officially released!

WindPress (portmanteau of "Tailwind" and "WordPress") is a new kind of WordPress plugin that reimagined how you can use Tailwind CSS with WordPress. Think of it as a bridge between Tailwind CSS and WordPress, allowing you to use Tailwind CSS in WordPress without the need for a development environment that supports modern Javascript build tools. That means you can use Tailwind CSS in any WordPress site, even those hosted on shared hosting.

## Why WindPress?

The use of Tailwind CSS in WordPress is still limited to WordPress theme usage, and it requires a development environment that supports modern Javascript build tools. The increasing popularity of WordPress page builders like Gutenberg, Elementor, Oxygen, and Bricks has created a high demand for integrating Tailwind CSS directly into WordPress page builders.
