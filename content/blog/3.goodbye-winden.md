**We are the original team behind Winden**, the WordPress plugin that brought Tailwind CSS experience to the Page Builder. As we move forward independently, the project evolves into its next chapter — **now reborn as WindPress**.

WindPress is not just a rebranding; it’s a complete overhaul of the original Winden plugin. Built from scratch, WindPress is designed to be faster, more stable, extendable, and enjoyable to use.

## What’s New in WindPress?

Before we began the overhaul, we took a step back to understand what Winden was missing and how we could make it better. Your feedback guided us to redesign everything with purpose. Here’s what WindPress brings to the table:

### :icon{name="logos:tailwindcss-icon" class="align-baseline mr-1.5"} Tailwind CSS `4.x` Support

This year, the Tailwind Labs team released the Tailwind CSS version `4.x`. It's a significant update that optimized for performance and flexibility, with a reimagined configuration and customization experience, and taking full advantage of the latest advancements the web platform has to offer.

WindPress is all set to support the latest version of Tailwind CSS, version `4.x`. This means you’ll have access to all the latest features and improvements. On the other hand, Winden was only supporting version `3.x`, which is now a bit outdated.

### :icon{name="logos:tailwindcss-icon" class="align-baseline mr-1.5"} Tailwind CSS `3.x` Compatibility

Not ready to switch? No worries — WindPress supports both Tailwind CSS `3.x` and `4.x`, so you can transition on your terms while still using the latest version of WindPress.


### ✨ Always Up-to-Date

Tailwind’s minor and patch updates are backward-compatible. This means you can safely update to the latest version without worrying about compatibility issues.

In the past, Winden gave users the option to select a specific minor or patch version of Tailwind CSS. While well-intentioned, this added unnecessary complexity. WindPress simplifies this by always using the latest stable version of Tailwind CSS. This ensures you automatically benefit from the newest improvements without extra configuration. It also reduces maintenance overhead and helps keep your projects up to date with best practices.

### ⛓️ A Unified Engine

<!-- Winden’s legacy architecture involved different engines for development and production, causing inconsistencies and bugs. WindPress fixes this with a unified engine that works seamlessly in all environments. -->

Winden initially relied on a messy architecture that was hard to maintain. It used different setups for development and production—Play CDN for development and GitHub Actions for production—leading to inconsistencies and bugs. To simplify things, we moved to using Play CDN in both environments. However, this approach is still somewhat unreliable, as it depends on JSPM CDN to run the engine.

WindPress fixes this by building a new unified engine that works seamlessly in both development and production environments. The new core is lighter, faster, and built to last — and yes, it’s fully open source. [View the engine on GitHub →](https://github.com/wind-press/windpress/tree/main/assets/packages/core/tailwindcss)

Rebuilding the core package from scratch has allowed us to reduce the dependencies and streamline the codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend. This new architecture is designed to be more robust, efficient, and future-proof, ensuring that WindPress can grow and adapt as the web evolves. The dual Tailwind CSS support (both `3.x` and `4.x`) is a testament to this flexibility and adaptability of the new architecture.

### 📁 Simple Virtual File System

WindPress introduces a virtual file system that acts like a file manager for your Tailwind CSS project. It helps you organize styles in a cleaner, more structured way by allowing you to split them into separate files and import them into a main stylesheet. This modular approach makes it easier to manage large projects, reuse code, and maintain consistency across your design system.

### 📦 Bundled Assets for Full Offline Support

In line with [WordPress.org plugin guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/common-issues/#:~:text=Files:%20Calling%20files%20remotely), WindPress includes all plugin's assets directly in the plugin — served locally from your server.

You get:

* Offline-ready performance
* No reliance on external CDNs
* Faster and more private environments

However, an internet connection is still needed to load Tailwind CSS plugins from the `esm.sh` CDN.

### 🧩 Built-in Tailwind CSS Plugins Support

Use Tailwind CSS plugins like `@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/typography`, and more with zero setup. Just import them into your config, and WindPress handles the rest — loading any `npm` packages via the `esm.sh` CDN automatically.
