Today we are so excited to announce that WindPress is officially released! üéâ

**WindPress** (portmanteau of "**Tailwind**" and "**WordPress**") is a new kind of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/){target="_blank"} plugin that reimagined how you can use Tailwind CSS with WordPress. 

Think of it as a bridge between [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){target="_blank"} and WordPress, allowing you to use Tailwind CSS in WordPress without the need for a development environment that supports [modern Javascript build tools](https://vite.dev/){target="_blank"}. That means you can use Tailwind CSS in any WordPress site, even those hosted on shared hosting.

## Tailwind CSS in WordPress: Is It Ready for Everyone?

Tailwind CSS has revolutionized modern web design with its utility-first approach, enabling developers to build responsive and maintainable interfaces efficiently. However, integrating Tailwind CSS into WordPress has traditionally been a challenge, especially for users who rely on WordPress page builders or work in environments without modern JavaScript build tools.

The most common challenges faced by users who want to use Tailwind CSS in WordPress include:

- **Requires a Development Environment** 

  Tailwind usually needs a build process, which isn't ideal for users on shared hosting or those who prefer a no-code/low-code approach.

- **Limited Page Builder Support**

  While Tailwind CSS is widely used in custom theme development, it is not natively supported by popular WordPress page builders like [Breakdance](/docs/integrations/breakdance), GeneratePress, [Builderius](/docs/integrations/builderius), and Kadence.

- **Complex Setup**

  Using Tailwind in WordPress themes or plugins often involves configuring build tools ‚Äî something that can be overwhelming for those unfamiliar with modern frontend workflows. The Play CDN is designed for development purposes only, and is not intended for production.

## üöÄ A Journey to Make Tailwind CSS Mainstream in WordPress

For years, we have been an active part of the WordPress and Page Builders community, gaining invaluable insights into the ever-evolving ecosystem. Our hands-on experience has allowed us to deeply understand the technical intricacies of Page Builders, from their core functionalities to the finer details that make them unique.

Through continuous learning üìö and collaboration with the community and Page Builders team, we have honed our expertise in creating WordPress plugins that cater to the needs of modern web creators.

üê£ Our initial step involved building the WindPress plugin. WindPress represents the peak of our journey and showcases our dedication to making Tailwind CSS more accessible for everyone.

## üî• Why WindPress is a Game Changer?

Using Tailwind CSS in WordPress usually requires a theme-based approach and modern build tools, making it less accessible for many users. With page builders like [Gutenberg](/docs/integrations/gutenberg), Elementor, [Oxygen](/docs/integrations/oxygen), and [Bricks](/docs/integrations/bricks) becoming more popular, there's a growing need for an easier way to integrate Tailwind CSS.

WindPress simplifies this process ‚Äî just install the plugin and start using Tailwind in your page builder. No build steps üöß, no config files ‚öôÔ∏è, and no extra setup üß™ involved. It's designed to work with any WordPress environment, making Tailwind CSS more accessible without disrupting existing workflows.
