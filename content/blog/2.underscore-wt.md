## üçª Based on the _tw theme

`_wt` is a fork/modified version of the _tw theme featuring the latest updates from [commit `de60a04`](https://github.com/gregsullivan/_tw/commit/de60a041285dce270c14cb545f9a70cc94665300). The `_wt` theme retains the core structure and functionality of _tw while adding Tailwind CSS support through the WindPress plugin, making it easier to use without a local development environment.

Some of the notable changes include:

1. The `_wt` theme is now available as a standalone theme, without the need for the [_tw starter theme generator](https://underscoretw.com/).

1. Removal of the Composer and Node.js dependencies, to simplify the setup process and make it compatible with shared hosting environments.
    File that were removed:
    - `composer.json`
    - `composer.lock`
    - `package.json`
    - `package-lock.json`
    - etc.

1. Updating the `_tw` keywords to `_wt` across the theme files, to reflect the new theme name.

1. Move the `tailwind.css` file to the `tailwindcss` directory and update the content to be compatible with the WindPress plugin.

1. Include the final build of script files into the `js` directory.

1. Updating the `functions.php` file to remove the extra assets and scripts that are not needed in the `_wt` theme.
    ```php [functions.php]
    // Enqueue editor styles.
    // add_editor_style( 'style-editor.css' );
    // add_editor_style( 'style-editor-extra.css' );
    ```

1. Integrating the `_wt` theme with the WindPress plugin by adding the `windpress.php` file to the `inc` directory. The integrations includes:
    - Register the `_wt` theme provider for the WindPress Compiler's scanner.
    - Register the SFS handler (get and save) for the `_wt` theme files in the `tailwindcss` directory. This allows you to edit the Tailwind CSS files directly in the WindPress file editor.
